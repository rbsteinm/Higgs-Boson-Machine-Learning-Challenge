PCML - project 1
Ella, Maxime, Raphaël

* The file implementations.py contains all our functions. It is divided in three parts:
	- functions we had to implement: contains the six functions we were asked to implement
	- helper functions: contains all functions we needed in order to perfoms our ML tasks that are not in the above section
	- some demos methods: contains some methods that we call in the notebook for demonstration purpose.

* If you run the file run.py it will save a file 'predictions.csv' containing our best predictions

* Our notebook is well documented. You can either run it entirely (although some sections might take some time to run) or only run the sections you're interested in.

* Basically we played around with all the methods in section "Computing the weights with different methods" section for some time, which led us to notice that the method
that gave us the best results was Ridge Regression. Thus, we decided to contentrate our efforts on this method, doing the stuff you can see in section "Data Processing and Predictions".
