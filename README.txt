# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge

This is our solution to the [Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson). This project was conducted in the scope of the course *Pattern Classification and Machine Learning (EPFL, Prof. Rüdiger Urbanke)*. Our progression and different approaches are explained in the Jupyter Notebook *project1.ipynb*, and in the report.

### Code organisation

* The file implementations.py contains all our functions. It is divided in three parts:
	- _functions we had to implement:_ contains the six functions we were asked to implement
	- _helper functions:_ contains all functions we needed in order to perfoms our ML tasks that are not in the above section
	- _some demos methods:_ contains some methods that we call in the notebook for demonstration purpose.

* If you run the file *run.py* it will save a file *predictions.csv* containing our best predictions

* Our notebook is well documented. You can either run it entirely (although some sections might take some time to run) or only run the sections you're interested in.
